git remote add origin [url] //adds new remote
git push --set-upstream origin [branch name] //sets default push/pull branch to the origin/[branch name]

origin is just the home page of the directory

This way, don't have to type url over and over.

The run.bat files are for debugging. They have a pause after running so I can read the error codes.
